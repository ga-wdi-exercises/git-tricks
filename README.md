## Branches
- `git push --delete  <branch_name>`: Delete remote branch.  see: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2003505/delete-a-git-branch-both-locally-and-remotely

git checkout -b <new_branch_name> - create a new branch and check it out in one step

git commit -am "fsjfklfa" <---this adds and commit at the same time!
